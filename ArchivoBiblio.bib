	abstract = {An image processing technique is developed in order to guide Chokun orange maturity sorting. The objective of this research is to assess the fruit maturity by color grading. The process is divided into two major steps, the training step and the testing step. In the training step, images of 90 Chokun oranges of three different degrees graded by an experienced farmer are collected by a color digital camera under the normal illumination conditions with white fluorescent lamps. Then, the original RGB (Red, Green and Blue) color image of an orange is transformed into an ISH (Intensity, Saturation and Hue) image. From the hue images, the hue colors are analyzed and then used to form decision rules. A classifier is implemented using these decision rules. In the testing step, the degree of maturity of 50 Chokun orange samples is tested. The Chokun orange maturity sorting is done by using the classifier obtained from the training step. The experimental results show that the method of grading the Chokun oranges could be a feasible alternative with a success rate of about 98 %.

To the best of our knowledge, no paper in the literature takes into account the multiple classifier scheme as additional design parameter, mainly because of lack of efficient hardware combiner architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer of date fruit. It produces almost 400 date varieties in bulk. During the harvesting season the date grading and sorting pose problems for date growers. Since it is a labor intensive and time consuming process, it delays the post harvesting operations which costs them dearly. The date grading and sorting is a repetitive process. In practice, it is carried out by humans manually through visual inspection. The manual inspection poses further problems in maintaining consistency in grading and uniformity in sorting. To speed up the process as well as maintain the consistency and uniformity we have designed and implemented a prototypical computer vision based date grading and sorting system. We have defined a set of external quality features. The system uses RGB images of the date fruits. From these images, it automatically extracts the aforementioned external date quality features. Based on the extracted features it classifies dates into three quality categories (grades 1, 2 and 3) defined by experts. We have studied the performance of a back propagation neural network classifier and tested the accuracy of the system on preselected date samples. The test results show that the system can sort 80% dates accurately.},

  Abstract                 = {Contemporary Vision and Pattern Recognition problems such as face recognition, fingerprinting identification, image categorization, and DNA sequencing often have an arbitrarily large number of classes and properties to consider. To deal with such complex problems using just one feature descriptor is a difficult task and feature fusion may become mandatory. Although normal feature fusion is quite effective for some problems, it can yield unexpected classification results when the different features are not properly normalized and preprocessed. Besides it has the drawback of increasing the dimensionality which might require more training data. To cope with these problems, this paper introduces a unified approach that can combine many features and classifiers that requires less training and is more adequate to some problems than a naïve method, where all features are simply concatenated and fed independently to each classification algorithm. Besides that, the presented technique is amenable to continuous learning, both when refining a learned model and also when adding new classes to be discriminated. The introduced fusion approach is validated using a multi-class fruit-and-vegetable categorization task in a semi-controlled environment, such as a distribution center or the supermarket cashier. The results show that the solution is able to reduce the classification error in up to 15 percentage points with respect to the baseline.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a novel method to recognize stem or calyx regions of ‘Jonagold’ apples by pattern recognition is proposed. The method starts with background removal and object segmentation by thresholding. Statistical, textural and shape features are extracted from each segmented object and these features are introduced to several supervised classification algorithms. Linear discriminant, nearest neighbor, fuzzy nearest neighbor, support vector machines classifiers and adaboost are the ones tested. Relevant features are selected by floating forward feature selection algorithm. Support vector machines, which is found to be the best among all classification algorithms tested, correctly recognized 99% of the stems and 100% of the calyxes using selected feature subset. These results exhibit considerable improvement relative to the ones introduced in the literature.},

abstract = {The technology for building knowledge-based systems by inductive inference from examples has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications. This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.},
